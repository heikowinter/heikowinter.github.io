<h1>Heiko Winter, a German Design Leader <br> based in Stockholm specialising in <br>

<p>Guten Tag!
 
    I’m Heiko, a German Designer based in Stockholm with 20 years of experience specialising in <br>
    product design and motion with strong roots in graphic design and branding.
</p>
    
<p>With a background in both agency and in-house product delivery teams, I’ve worked across various <br>
    industries. I adapt quickly and excel in visual details and motion design.</p>
    
<p>I believe you can create great things with craft, good process and structure.</p>
    
<p>I both lead teams and roll up my design sleeves when needed. I bring structure and process to a team, <br>
    coaching designers and up-levelling the quality through working together on hands-on challenges.</p>
    
<p>Outside of work, I teach at the design university in Schwäbisch Gmünd, helping to shape future talent.<br>
    
<p>While my work is primarily digital and interactive, I‘m passionate about design across all mediums. </p>
