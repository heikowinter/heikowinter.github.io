        <h1>Heiko Winter, a German Design Leader <br> based in Stockholm specialising in <br>
            product design, branding & motion</h1>
        <p>Guten Tag!<br>
        
            I’m Heiko, a German Designer based in Stockholm with 20 years of experience specialising in <br>
            product design and motion with strong roots in graphic design and branding.
        </p>
            
        <p>With a background in both agency and in-house product delivery teams, I’ve worked across various <br>
            industries. I adapt quickly and excel in visual details and motion design.</p>
            
        <p>I believe you can create great things with craft, good process and structure.</p>
            
        <p>I both lead teams and roll up my design sleeves when needed. I bring structure and process to a team, <br>
            coaching designers and up-levelling the quality through working together on hands-on challenges.</p>
            
        <p>Outside of work, I teach at the design university in Schwäbisch Gmünd, helping to shape future talent.<br>
        
        <p>While my work is primarily digital and interactive, I‘m passionate about design across all mediums. </p>
