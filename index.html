<p>Guten Tag!
 
    I’m Heiko, a German Designer based in Stockholm with 20 years of experience specialising in
    product design and motion with strong roots in graphic design and branding.
    
    With a background in both agency and in-house product delivery teams, I’ve worked across various
    industries. I adapt quickly and excel in visual details and motion design.
    
    I believe you can create great things with craft, good process and structure.
    
    I both lead teams and roll up my design sleeves when needed. I bring structure and process to a team, 
    coaching designers and up-levelling the quality through working together on hands-on challenges.
    
    Outside of work, I teach at the design university in Schwäbisch Gmünd, helping to shape future talent.
    
    While my work is primarily digital and interactive, I‘m passionate about design across all mediums. </p>
